I am currently a postdoctoral researcher at Télécom Paris, Institut Polytechnique de Paris, working with Prof. Pavlo Mozharovskyi. I completed my Ph.D. at the Tata Institute of Fundamental Research – Centre for Applicable Mathematics (TIFR CAM) & ESSEC CREAR, under the supervision of [Prof. Sreekar Vadlamani](https://sreekar.tifrbng.res.in/teaching) and [Prof. Marie Kratz](https://faculty.essec.edu/en/cv/kratz-marie/).

My research focuses on data depth, multivariate statistics, extremes, multivariate risks, optimization, and stochastic processes. I am also interested in the application of optimal transport in statistics.
